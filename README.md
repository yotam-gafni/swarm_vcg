# Swarm SVG Simulation

# Usage
Run the tests using 
cd tests/
python3.6 swarm_vcg_test.py

Feel free to add new tests and play with it by changing sellers' reserve prices, buyers' bids, download and upload rates and number of participants.

# Issues
- Speed and efficiency. This is a very straightforward implementation of VCG. There are many ways to improve it, whethre in the code or by using better or approximate algorithms.
- Usability. It could have been super nice to have a UI where you could experiment with different scenarios. Ultimately, I would be happy to get this package to be an online "Swarm Combinatorial VCG Calculator" you can go into and play with.
